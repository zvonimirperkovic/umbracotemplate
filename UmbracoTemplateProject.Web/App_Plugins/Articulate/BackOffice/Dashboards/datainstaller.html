            This will ensure that Articulate's schema (Document Types, Data Types, Media Types, etc...) is installed correctly
            and will install a default Blog into the root of your content tree.

                If you've installed Articulate via Nuget you will need to use this to install the required Articulate data
            </li>
            <li>
                This will sync any new schema changes that Articulate requires with your existing schema if Articulate is already installed
            </li>
            <li>
                This will <strong>not</strong> remove any Property Types or Data Types that you've manually created on top of the standard Articulate schema properties
            </li>

            You can either modify this demo data or simply remove it once you are comfortable with how Articulate works.
            The demo data includes: a blog post, an author, a category and a tag.
